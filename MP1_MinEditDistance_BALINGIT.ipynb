        "1. How does your algorithm work (from distance calculation to backtracing)?\n",
        "    - The algorithm works such that I follow the step-by-step process taught in class, starting from the initialization step with D(i,0) and D(0,j), to the filling up of the matrix by computing for the min() between the three obtained values, and to the backtracing of the matrix to build the completed string.\n",
        "    - The initialization step just fills up the dp array with empty values first, then fills it according to the value of the letter in the for loop's current iteration.\n",
        "    - The filling up of the dp array step is done by checking the adjacent cells to the current cell and finding the minimum value from there. These values will then be used to backtrace for the insertion, deletion, and substitution later on.\n",
        "    - As for the backtrace step, I could not figure out the algorithm myself, given just the chart we were shown in class. And so, I resulted in following [this YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3KYnQ-VEhs) of how Edit Distance is written in Python. What I've done is to allow for the algorithm to reconstruct the optimal path by starting at D(n,m) and work backwards to D(0,0). To resolve ambiguities where multiple paths might offer the same minimum cost, my implementation prioritizes operations in the following order: Diagonal (Match/Mismatch), then Horizontal (Insertion), and finally Vertical (Deletion). \n",
        "        - What I mean by this is that the backtrace step tries to find the most optimal path towards the final minimum edit distance by checking if it can move diagonally up-left; if not, then check if it can move horizontally left; and if still not, check if it can move up. For each of those steps, an equivalent Match, Mismatch, Insert, and Delete operation is derived. Implementing it this way ensures that the alignment prefers substituting characters over introducing gaps when the costs are equal.\n",
        "2. What modifications are present (if any) and why were they made?\n",
        "    - I don't think I made any modifications to the Minimum Distance Algorithm taught in class.\n",
        "3. What biases might the algorithm have or what operations were prioritized?\n",
        "    - I don't think I programmed my algorithm to have any biases. However, upon analyzing the code structure and after asking Gemini regarding this peculiar question, I was told that: because I checked for j-1 (Insertion) before i-1 (Deletion), my implementation has a bias toward Insertion in ambiguous cases where Insertion and Deletion costs might be tied.\n",
        "4. Was there anything surprising about the results of the test cases or did the algorithm you coded produce the expected alignments?\n",
        "    - All of the test cases I have tested my code over produced the expected results. The test case for levinstien to levenshtein, for example, was insightful. Because the cost of a Substitution (2) is exactly equal to an Insertion (1) + Deletion (1), I confirmed that the algorithm is mathematically *indifferent* between swapping a letter versus deleting it and inserting a new one. However, due to my prioritization of Mismatches (Diagonal) first, the algorithm attempts to align the characters i and e as a substitution rather than creating gaps. This produced a more compact visual alignment, which aligns with how we as humans typically perceive typos.\n",
        "    - On a separate note, I do think that if I approach the problem with a totally different lens, I could achieve a surprising outcome. Instead of approaching this as a dynammic programming problem, I could approach it as a graph traversal one and implement an A_star algorithm solution. I could then theoretically improve the best case of the solution. Unlike an exhaustive dynammic programming's best case and worst case being O(nm), the informed A_star solution would have a best case of Ω(k) and still a worst case of O(nm), where k is the path length.\n",
        "5. Is the weighting scheme of 1-1-2-0 appropriate or should alternative weights be used? You might want to experiment with this using your program.\n",
        "    - I think that this is the most appropriate way to implement weights for the different edit distance operations. A regular Insert or Delete operation should only cost 1 and a Match operation should only cost 0, but a Substitute operation should have a cost of 2 because we can interpret it as performing a Delete *THEN* Insert operation behind the scenes."
